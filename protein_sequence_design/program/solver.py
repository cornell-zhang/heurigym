def solve_hp_sequence(residue_data, dist_matrix, sasa_values, alpha, beta):
    """
    Main solver function: builds the graph and computes the min-cut to find
    the optimal H/P sequence.

    Args:
        residue_data (list): List of residue data dicts.

     Returns:
        str or None: The optimal H/P sequence, or None if an error occurs
                     during graph building or min-cut that prevents sequence generation.
