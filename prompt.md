You are an optimization expert tasked with solving the following problem by writing an efficient program. Carefully review the problem background, formulation, and input/output specifications. Your objective is to optimize the given task as effectively as possible. You may implement any algorithm you like, but external libraries are not permitted. The evaluation environment uses Python 3.12 and has sufficient CPU and memory resources to run your program. Please strictly follow the instructions below.

## Problem Information
{PROBLEM}

## Program Template
{EXAMPLE_PROGRAM}

## Instructions
1. A problem template is provided above. You only need to implement the `solve` function. Do NOT modify the function signature including the data types of the input arguments. You are free to use any data structures or algorithms within this function, but please make sure you have imported necessary libraries and modules.
2. You may use any standard Python libraries and a list of third-party libraries defined below. Other external libraries are strictly prohibited.
    - numpy
    - scipy
3. Your submission should consist of a single file named `solver.py` that contains the complete implementation of the `solve` function. Do NOT include any explanations, comments, additional text, or Markdown formatting.

Take a deep breath and approach the problem step by step. Try to be creative and strive to find the best possible solution.
