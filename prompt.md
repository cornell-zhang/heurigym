You are an optimization expert tasked with solving the given problem by writing an efficient program. Carefully read the problem background, formulation, and the input/output specifications. Your goal is to optimize the objective as effectively as possible. You can write any programs you like without using external libraries. The evaluation machine has enough resources to run your program. Please try to figure out the most efficient solution.

## Problem Information
{PROBLEM}

## Program Template
{EXAMPLE PROGRAM}

## Instructions
1. A problem template is provided above. You only need to implement the "solve" function. Do not modify the function signatureâ€”only complete the body of the function.
2. You may use standard libraries, but external libraries are not allowed. At the beginning of your code, please include a list of the standard libraries you use.
3. Only output the code. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional text.

Take a deep breath and approach the problem step by step. Strive to find the best possible solution.
